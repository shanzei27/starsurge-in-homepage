                        <p>As referenced above, even though you may buy Virtual Items with &quot;real-world&quot; money, you do not, in fact, &quot;own&quot; such items. By making such a purchase, you are merely being granted a license to use such Virtual Items in the applicable Apps or other Services for which such Virtual Items can be used. The Virtual Items have no real-world value and are not in any way a credit or balance of real currency or its equivalent. In no event can any Virtual Items be redeemed for actual, &quot;real-world&quot; currency. We have the sole and absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Items as we see fit in our sole discretion, and shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.</p>

                        <p>You are prohibited from posting on or transmitting through the Services (e.g., through uploaded content, a chat or user forum, online review or comment posted through the Services) any content that infringes upon a third party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights or is defamatory, damaging, illegal, or offensive.</p>
                        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, you may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way on the Services any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information belonging to others unless you have first obtained the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights. It is our policy to terminate the account of anyone who repeatedly infringes the copyright rights of others upon our receipt of proper notification from the copyright owner or the copyright owner&rsquo;s legal agent.</p>
                        <p>By submitting content or materials (&quot;Your Content&quot;) to us through the Services, including, without limitation, uploading any materials, choosing a username, or participation in any chats or forums, you automatically grant us, or warrant that the owner of such content has expressly granted us, the royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, publish, translate, prepare derivative works of, copy, perform and distribute Your Content, including all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such content, and your username, actual name, and likeness (if submitted), in whole or in part worldwide, including in connection with announcing you as the winner of a sweepstakes/contest or including you in leaderboards. You also hereby grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to access Your Content through the Services, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform Your Content as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under this Agreement. The above licenses granted by you in Your Content are perpetual and will only terminate if you&apos;ve requested the removal or deletion of Your Content from the Services (such license will terminate within a commercially reasonable time after your request to remove or delete Your Content). You understand and agree, however, that we may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of Your Content that have been removed or deleted. The foregoing is subject to the provision regarding Unsolicited Submissions below.</p>
                        <p>Subject to these grants, you retain any and all rights which may exist in Your Content.</p>
                        <p>We may disclose any of Your Content or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate our Services; (iii) to protect the rights or property of Starsurge and our officers, directors, employees and agents; or (iv) to protect the Starsurge Providers and any other user.</p>
                        <h3>C. Advertising</h3>

                        <h3>D. Representations and Warranties</h3>
                        <p>You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize us to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all of Your Content and to enable inclusion and use of Your Content in the manner contemplated by the Services and this Agreement. You further represent and warrant Your Content will not defame any third party and that the use of Your Content on the Services will not violate or infringe upon the intellectual property rights, or the rights of privacy or publicity, of any third party.</p>
                        <h3>E. Third-Party Content &amp; User Content</h3>
                        <p>You acknowledge that Starsurge is an online service provider that may post content supplied by third parties and users. We have no more editorial control over the content posted by such third parties (including User Content) than does a public library or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, judgments, services, offers, or other information that constitutes part of the content expressed or made available by third parties, including User Content, are those of the respective authors or distributors and not of Starsurge or its affiliates or any of their officers, directors, employees, or agents. While we retain the right to filter or reject User Content and other content posted by third parties, we review User Content and other third-party content in a limited gate-keeper fashion and have no obligation to investigate whether any User Content and other third-party content violate any term of this Agreement and will not do so in most cases. We neither endorse nor are responsible for the User Content or any other content posted to the Services by anyone other than Starsurge.</p>
                        <p>Just as you retain complete ownership of Your Content (subject to the license to us granted above), all other users of the Services retain ownership of their User Content. You may not modify, remove, delete, augment, add to, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, or in any way exploit any User Content in whole or in part.</p>
                        <h3>F. Unsolicited Submissions</h3>
                        <p>We are pleased to hear from our customers and welcome their comments regarding our Services. Unfortunately, however, long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as game ideas or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials. If, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information (collectively, the &quot;Unsolicited Submissions&quot;), the Unsolicited Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of Starsurge. None of the Unsolicited Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Starsurge, and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Unsolicited Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Unsolicited Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Unsolicited Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Unsolicited Submissions. You waive any and all moral rights in any such Unsolicited Submissions as well as any claim to a right of credit or approval. The foregoing shall also apply to any creative submissions you make at our specific request, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
                        <h3>VI. NOTICE OF INFRINGEMENT</h3>
                        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that any content, including User Content, or other materials, posted on the Services constitutes an infringement of your copyrights or trademarks, we will respond promptly to any properly submitted notice containing the information detailed below. Please send all notices to the following e-mail address:&nbsp;contact@starsurge.in.</p>
                        <p>To be effective, the notification must be a written communication that includes the following: 1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; 2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted; 5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 6.
